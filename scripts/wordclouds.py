----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two cuts of one analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first four figures fix the scenario type and pool the models, and the last
six fix the model and pool the types. Between them they answer two questions the
same scoring cannot answer at once: whether the vocabulary moves with age
differently depending on what was asked, and whether it moves differently
depending on which model was asked.

Holding one of the two constant is not a presentational choice. The four
scenario types expect different answers, so a word distinctive to a harmful
scenario is distinctive because it belongs to a refusal and one distinctive to a
rights scenario because it belongs to an answer; a figure pooling both reports
the mixture. The same argument runs the other way for models whose reply lengths
differ by a factor of three.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nine panels, and why the control is one of them
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three by three: the control condition, then the eight stated ages in order. The
control earns its panel because it is the baseline every age contrast in
Chapter 4 is read against, and a reader who cannot see what a model says when it
is told nothing has no reference for what it says when it is told an age.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each word is drawn once, at the condition where it scores highest
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scoring each condition independently put 'help', 'adult', 'parent' and 'school'
in every panel, because they are commoner at every minor age than at eighteen,
and the grid then read as one cloud repeated. So the scores are computed for all
nine conditions first and each word is kept only where its score is highest. The
assignment is the argument maximum of a score the corpus produced; nothing is
filtered by hand.

The cost is that a panel shows what separates it from its neighbours rather than
everything characteristic of it, which is the right trade for a figure whose
subject is the progression across the panels.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What these show, and what they must not be read as
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Size is the weighted log-odds ratio from language.distinctive_words(), with the
pooled cut as an informative prior, so a word is large only where it is commoner
in that condition than the cut as a whole predicts. It is not a frequency.
Position and orientation carry nothing, and each panel is scaled to its own
strongest word, so sizes rank within a panel and are not compared across them.

Tone carries the same ranking as size, on one perceptually uniform map read over
its dark half. Encoding the score twice is deliberate: relative area is hard to
judge in a packed layout and a reader can rank two words by tone when they
cannot by size.

Read as subject matter, never as vocabulary difficulty. Section 4.3.3 reports
mean AoA flat at 4.97 to 5.22 while grade level moves two to three grades, and
the two are consistent: a few dozen distinctive words out of a vocabulary of
thousands do not move a mean over every content word.

No floor is applied, unlike every other readability figure, since a word is a
word at any length and the fifty-word cut would remove the short refusals that
carry most of the referral vocabulary.

# The label is Neutral, matching config/settings.yml and every table in
# Chapters 3 and 4, so the figure and the text name one thing one way.
#
# The control sits last rather than first because the figure is a progression

# as an age below seven; placed at the foot it reads as the reference the eight
# are measured against, which is what Chapter 4 uses it for.

# Tone still ranks: the most distinctive word in a panel is the dark violet at
# the foot of the map and the least is the yellow-green at its head. The bright
# end measures only about 1.3:1 against white, so those words are faint, and
# that is a deliberate consequence rather than an oversight. They are also the
# smallest words in the panel, and what the figure is for is the handful at the
# top of each; a range dark enough to make the twenty-eighth word crisp

# Seven, not nine. The label is set inside the figure and competes with the
# panels for the same vertical space, so a target that reads comfortably as body
