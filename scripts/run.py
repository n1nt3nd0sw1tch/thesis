Replies append one line at a time and any prompt already collected is skipped,
so a run that stops part way resumes where it left off. That matters because a
full pass is tens of thousands of generations and will not finish in one
sitting. Run it with a limit first: the rate it reports is enough to estimate the
whole pass before committing a night to it. Progress prints once a minute rather
than per reply, so the log stays short enough to read the morning after.

The check looks every identifier up against its provider, so a renamed or
retired model fails here rather than part way through generation, and local
models are checked against the Hugging Face Hub so a missing repository is
caught before a cluster job starts. Naming a model puts one prompt through
generation, scoring and comparison as well; passing --reply instead scores a
supplied text, which exercises the scoring path without loading a large model.
