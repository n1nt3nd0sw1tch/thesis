"""The corpus, the statistics and the paths every analysis notebook shares.

    from analysis import (MAIN, SUPPLEMENT, ORDER, Register, contrast,
                          load_corpus, fingerprint_line, publish, save_figure)

Four notebooks read the same corpus and ask different questions of it.
Splitting them was worth doing, but it puts two things at risk. A bootstrap
seeded differently in two files gives two intervals for the same quantity and
nothing fails, and an outcome cell defined twice can be defined differently. So
the draws, the seed, the pairing rule, the panel, the outcome definition and the
corpus loader live here and the notebooks import them.

Every declared family is populated entirely inside one notebook, so each one
corrects its own families and writes the result to
tables/machine/register_<prefix>.csv. The reporting notebook concatenates the
registers for the audit table and reaches the same numbers, because it is
adjusting the same complete families. If a family ever needed to span two
notebooks, correction would have to move to the reporting pass, and that would
be a decision to take deliberately rather than a default to fall into.

FAMILIES is declared in full below, before any of it is populated. That is the
point of it. A family assembled after the results are in can always be drawn
around whatever survived, so Register refuses a family name it does not already
know, and adding one is a visible edit to this file rather than a keyword
argument in a notebook.

Paths. Tables are thesis output in the same sense figures are, so they sit at
tables/ beside figures/ rather than under results/, which holds data products.
tables/methods holds tables belonging to Chapter 3 or 4, tables/main the Chapter
5 body, tables/supplement the appendix. All three are committed; tables/machine
holds deterministic intermediates reproducible from the committed corpus.

# Identifier, display name, colour, marker. The order is the reporting order and
# is used everywhere, so a table and a figure never disagree about which column
# is which model.
#
# One model, one colour, across the whole thesis. The saturated value is what a
# figure draws with; style/preamble.tex highlights the same model in prose and
# in the model selection table with a 34 per cent tint of it, computed by TINT
# below. Defining the tint as a fraction rather than as a second hand-picked
# palette is what keeps the two from drifting: an earlier pair had Mistral red
# in the figures and peach in the text, close enough to Claude that the two were
# hard to tell apart in the table.
# The released names are those in Table~ref{tab:models} in the methods chapter,
# verbatim. A model is named the same way in a figure legend, a table row and a
# sentence, so the reader never has to work out that GPT and GPT-5.6 Luna are
# the same thing.
# Six of Tol's muted qualitative set, chosen by measurement rather than by eye.
# The minimum pairwise CIEDE2000 distance is 23.2 for normal vision, 18.5 under
# deuteranopia and 16.1 under protanopia. The set this replaces scored 13.8,
# 2.8 and 2.2: Claude and Gemma were separated by 2.8 for a red-green colourblind
# reader, which is no separation at all, and Gemini and DeepSeek by 3.3.
#
# The lightness spread is deliberate and load-bearing. A dichromat reads this
# panel largely by lightness, so flattening it to make the pale colours darker
# costs more than it gains: pulling sand and cyan toward the middle drops the
# protanopia minimum from 16.1 to 9.0. The pale lines are handled with weight
# instead, which is what LINEWIDTH and MARKERSIZE are for.
#
# Gemini and Gemma sit 54.0 apart, the widest gap in the set. They are the same
# provider and the design pairs them to separate deployment filtering from model
# behaviour, so that is the one comparison a reader must never have to squint at.
