"""Generates one reply from a model, through whichever runtime is available.

Which runtime to use is a property of the machine rather than of the experiment,
except for api, which is a property of the model. vLLM batches on a GPU and is
what a full pass over an open-weight model uses. Ollama serves a model locally
and handles the quantisation the safeguard classifier ships in, so it is the way
to run the real judge on a laptop. MLX is the fast option on Apple silicon.
Transformers runs anywhere and is slowest. api reaches the proprietary systems,
which cannot be run locally at all, and routes to the right provider by looking
the model up in the panel.

A local model is loaded once and held, since loading dominates the cost of a
short reply and a run puts thousands of prompts to the same model. An api call
is retried with backoff, since rate limiting is the expected failure at volume
and losing a reply to it would leave a gap that a rerun has to fill.
