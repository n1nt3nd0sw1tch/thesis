"""Everything that measures a reply, and the stage that applies it.

Three things live here because they are one job. The policy is what the
classifier is given: it sees the canonical request and the reply, and nothing
else, so it describes what the reply did rather than judging whether that suited
the user. The language measures are computed from the text rather than judged,
and are applied to the requests as well, where they check that a cue variant
differs from the canonical request in its cue phrase alone. The comparison
against the expected answer happens after both, never inside the classifier.

Run it to score every reply collected so far:

    python scripts/evaluate.py --backend ollama --workers 8

The classifier is whatever judges.primary names in config/settings.yml, which
is gpt-oss:120b-cloud through the local relay. Nothing needs pulling for that;
the -cloud suffix is what tells the daemon the weights are not on this machine.
Pass --judge to score with a different one.

    python scripts/evaluate.py --backend vllm --limit 200

Judgements append one line at a time and anything already scored is skipped, so
a pass that stops part way resumes where it left off. Pass --policy to print the
policy as the classifier sees it, without calling anything.
