"""Builds everything a model is asked, from the downloaded corpora and the design.

    python scripts/build.py            the benchmark, and the prompts from it
    python scripts/build.py turns      the dialogue extension, once replies exist

The first stage takes the pipeline from the source records to the file a model
is given, in three steps, each validated before the next reads it.

    drafts.csv     the candidate pool, one row per usable source record.
                   Regenerated on every run and not committed
    benchmark.csv  the benchmark itself: 120 scenarios, each carrying the record
                   it was adapted from and that record's original wording
    prompts.csv    every scenario expanded across the age conditions

Every condition is an opening sentence followed by the request, and the request
is the same text in all of them, so a prompt is the control plus at most one
sentence. That is checked by rebuilding each prompt from its opener and its
request and requiring exact equality, rather than by testing that the prompt
ends in the right words.

The scenarios are specified in config/scenarios.yml, which is the only file
edited by hand. Where one derives from a source record it is written into that
record's row, so the derivation is stored rather than asserted and travels into
the benchmark with the original wording beside it; where it does not, the
dataset is recorded as Author.

The second stage needs replies, so it is run after run.py rather than with the
first. It replays each opening reply and presses on the same request.
