"""Measures the language of every collected reply.

    python scripts/language.py
    python scripts/language.py --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
    python scripts/language.py --floor 0 --difficult 10

Reads results/adaptation/ and writes results/language/, one file per model.

These are computed from the text and need no model, which is why they are here
rather than in the judgement. A classification costs a call to a classifier and
cannot be revised without another one; readability costs arithmetic, so a change
of mind about how it is measured is a second rather than an afternoon.

Twelve measures in three groups.

    Readability, how hard the reply is to read
      FKGL              Flesch Kincaid grade level, US school year
      FRE               Flesch reading ease, 0 to 100, higher is easier
      Gunning Fog       years of education implied, weights long words
      ARI               automated readability index, characters not syllables
      SMOG              grade implied by polysyllable density

    Vocabulary, how early the words are learned
      Mean AoA          mean age of acquisition over words in the norms
      Max AoA           the latest-acquired word in the reply
      Difficult Share   share of words acquired after the threshold age
      AoA Coverage      share of words the norms carry at all

    Structure, what the reply is made of
      Response Length   words
      Sentence Length   words per sentence
      Lexical Variety   distinct words over total words

Two corpus-level comparisons live here too, since they are arithmetic over the
same text and belong beside the per-reply measures rather than in a notebook.
Cosine similarity asks how far the wording moves between conditions, and the
distinctive-word scores ask which words carry that movement. Both are described
where they are defined below.

Five formulas rather than two because they disagree in informative ways. FKGL
and FRE are two readings of the same two inputs, sentence length and syllables a
word, so they move together by construction and neither adds anything to the
other. Gunning Fog counts long words instead of syllables, ARI counts characters
instead of syllables, and SMOG counts only polysyllables, so a reply that is
simple by one and hard by another is telling you which property of the text is
doing the work. Reporting one of each family is the reason for the set.

A floor applies to the readability group, and it is an analysis decision rather
than a measurement one. Every measure here is computed without a length
restriction, and the notebook then treats the formula measures as missing below
fifty words, so the threshold can be varied without measuring again. Readability
formulas are unstable on
short texts and meaningless on very short ones: 'I cannot help with that' has a
grade level below zero, which is arithmetic rather than a finding. Replies under
the floor carry the structure and vocabulary measures, which are defined at any
length, and are left blank for the five formulas. The share left blank is
reported per model, since it differs enormously between them and is itself a
result: a model that refuses in six words is not missing data, it is refusing in
six words.
