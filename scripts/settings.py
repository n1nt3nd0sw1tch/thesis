"""The design, and where everything lives.

Reads config/settings.yml and config/scenarios.yml, and exposes what they state
along with everything that follows from it: the age conditions in full, the
expected answer of each scenario type, the columns each file carries. Nothing
here does any work. The machinery that acts on these values is in utils.py,
which imports this module rather than the other way round.
